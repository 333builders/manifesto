"Via Web2 we were given a chance to interact with each other and close distances among us. " +
"Web2 essentially allowed us to record our lives on the cloud, and made us live forever in the form of binary code.\n\n" +
"Web2 did give us a lot, but it failed at protecting its users. Indeed, the whole web2 ecosystem resulted in profits for a handful" +
" of companies, which employ the data acquired not only at their users&apos; expense, but often against them. Thus, a technology" +

"It is now the moment of taking back control of the web. Thanks to blockchain technology, we can now redistribute not only data, but power, rights, responsibilities and, ultimately, wealth, in a decentralized manner.\n\n" +
"Builders believe in the pledge of blockchain technology, the one of creating a better, disintermediated future, in pursuit of equality.\n\n" +
"On such assumptions, the community of 333.Builders was born, with the goal of becoming the main Italian ecosystem and innovation vehicle for web3-related and blockchain-powered projects.\n\n" +
"As of today, 333.Builders is the first Italian community of professionals in the web3 ecosystem, whose mission is to accelerate the adoption pace of blockchain technology on a national" +
" scale first, and towards a global perspective in a second moment.\n\n" +
"We are planning to do so by building a self-sufficient ecosystem for the development, acceleration and funding of web3 solutions, in which professionals, innovative startups, enterprises and" +
" investors take part. In 333.Builders everyone can find partners, co-founders, consultancy, finances and valuable feedback. Thus, on top of a decentralized community, projects are born," +
" supported, undertake a due-diligence process and are finally funded.";
